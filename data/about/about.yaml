title: "Why <strong class=\"text-pink-500\">D’Bleu</strong> exists"

text: |
  I spent two decades inside corporates watching brilliant strategies die in delivery hell. Budgets ballooned, teams burned out, execs blamed “culture.” I refused that narrative.
  <br><br>
  <h1><b>My inflection point</b></h1>
  <br>
  In 2017 I parachuted into a Tier-1 European bank where a €120 m digital programme was 14 months late. We rebuilt the value stream, axed 40 % vanity scope and shipped the MVP in 11 weeks. Board risk rating: green. That win proved a simple truth—velocity is a leadership choice, not a luck factor.
  <br><br>
  <h1><b>From operator to founder</b></h1>
  <br>
  I founded <b>D’Bleu</b> to scale that mindset beyond a single employer. The name blends my surname <b>Bloo</b> (French: <b>Bleu</b>) with the <b>D</b>elta symbol for change—digital, decisive, data-driven.
  <br><br>
  At D’Bleu, we don’t just offer advice; we actively step in, lead, and deliver results. Our approach combines strategic insight with strong execution:
  <br><br>
  <h1><b>What we believe</b></h1>
  <br>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
   <li><b>Timebox everything.</b> Indefinite projects breed indefinite excuses.</li>
   <li><b>Data beats drama.</b> Decisions anchored in flow metrics, not politics.</li>
   <li><b>Leaders remove friction.</b> They don’t chair meetings; they unblock.</li>
   <li><b>Change sticks when teams win.</b> Celebrate small wins every sprint.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <h1><b>What we do</b></h1>
  <br>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
    <li><b>Interim Leadership</b> act as temporary CIO, CTO or RTE within 48 h.</li>
    <li><b>Program & Change Execution</b> rescue stalled initiatives, restore cadence.</li>
    <li><b>Digital & Organisational Transformation</b> wire the business for continuous value flow.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <h1><b>Impact so far</b></h1>
  <br>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
    <li>Cut idea-to-cash lead-time by <b>60 %</b> for a global telco (5 k staff).</li>
    <li>Tripled release frequency for a fintech scale-up, unlocking Series C funding.</li>
    <li>Saved €18 m OPEX in 12 months for a Tier-1 bank through Lean Portfolio.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <h1><b>Why it matters to you</b></h1>
  <br>
  Your competitors aren’t waiting. Neither should you. If clarity, cadence and cash are stuck in the mud, we need a 30-minute call—nothing fluffy, just a brutal assessment of where you are versus where you said you’d be.
