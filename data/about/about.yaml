  text: |
    I’m **Jurjen Bloo**—the fixer boards call when €100 m programmes flat-line.  
    After two decades turning chaos into cadence for banks, telcos and scale-ups,  
    I founded **D’Bleu** to inject that execution DNA into organisations that refuse  
    to stay average. Promise: clarity 48 h, momentum 30 d, results 90 d.

    - title: "The Problem I Kept Seeing"
      copy: |
        I spent two decades inside corporates watching brilliant strategies die in delivery hell.  
        Budgets ballooned, teams burned out, execs blamed “culture.” I refused that narrative.
    - title: "My Inflection Point"
      copy: |
        In 2017 I parachuted into a Tier-1 European bank where a €120 m digital programme was  
        14 months late. We rebuilt the value stream, axed 40 % vanity scope and shipped the MVP  
        in 11 weeks. Board risk rating: green. Lesson: **velocity is a leadership choice, not luck.**
    - title: "From Operator to Founder"
      copy: |
        I founded **D’Bleu** to scale that mindset beyond a single employer. The name blends my  
        surname **Bloo** (French *Bleu*) with the **Δ** (delta) symbol for change—digital, decisive, data-driven.
