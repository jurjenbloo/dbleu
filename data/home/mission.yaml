    text: "I’m Jurjen Bloo, the fixer boards call when €100 m programmes flat-line. After 20 years turning chaos into cadence for banks, telcos and scale-ups, I built D’Bleu to inject that execution DNA into organisations that refuse to settle for average. My promise: clarity in 48 hours, momentum in 30 days, results in 90."
