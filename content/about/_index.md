## What We Do
- **[Interim Leadership](/approach/#interim-leadership)**: Acting C-suite / programme lead to stabilise direction and delivery.  
- **[Programme & Change Execution](/approach/#program--change-execution)**: From chaos to cadence; stalled initiatives shipped.  
- **[Digital & Organisational Transformation](/approach/#digital--organisational-transformation)**: Operating model, data and ways-of-working wired for continuous value flow.

## How We Work (First 90 Days)
- **0–48 hours — Triage & truth.** Gemba listening at every level, system map, risks and constraints surfaced.  
- **Days 3–7 — Stabilise.** Reset decision rights, install an operating rhythm, make metrics visible.  
- **Days 8–30 — Align.** North-Star OKRs, ruthless backlog management, quarterly roadmap locked.  
- **Days 31–90 — Deliver.** Non-negotiable milestones hit; internal leaders coached; playbook + dashboard handed over.

## Proof (Snapshots)
- **Business unit turnaround.** Contracts expiring, BD immature, no CRM access. **24-hour** rescue plan; within a month most contracts extended; recruitment, performance and L&D rebuilt. **Result: +30% revenue.**  
- **National energy data platform (NL).** Politically sensitive, technically complex, stalled for years. Introduced SAFe, professionalised international collaboration, added real-time delivery analytics. **Outcome: nationwide go-live; future-proof foundation.**  
- **Global media/telecom delivery.** 500+ people across five countries. SAFe business case, health checks, agile practices and delivery intelligence. **Cycle time 40 → 36 weeks; confidence up; data-driven culture.**

## What We Believe
- **Timebox everything.** Indefinite projects create indefinite excuses.  
- **Data beats drama.** Decisions ride on flow metrics, not politics.  
- **Leaders remove friction.** They unblock work, not chair meetings.  
- **Change sticks when teams win weekly.** Momentum > memos.

## Founder Spotlight
