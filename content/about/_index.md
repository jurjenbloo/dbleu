> *“Velocity is a leadership choice, not luck.”*  

I’m **Jurjen Bloo**—the fixer boards call when €100 m programmes flat-line.  
After two decades turning chaos into cadence for banks, telcos and scale-ups, I founded **D’Bleu** to inject that execution DNA into organisations that refuse to stay average.

## The problem I kept seeing  
Brilliant strategies died in delivery hell. Budgets ballooned, teams burned out, execs blamed “culture.” I refused that narrative.

## My inflection point — 2017  
A Tier-1 European bank’s €120 m digital programme was **14 months late**.  
We rebuilt the value stream, axed **40 %** vanity scope and shipped the MVP in **11 weeks**. Board risk rating: green.

## From operator to founder  
The name **D’Bleu** blends my surname *Bloo* (French *Bleu*) with the delta symbol Δ for change—digital, decisive, data-driven.

## What we believe  
- **Timebox everything.** Indefinite projects breed indefinite excuses.  
- **Data beats drama.** Decisions anchored in flow metrics, not politics.  
- **Leaders remove friction.** They don’t chair meetings; they unblock.  
- **Change sticks when teams win.** Celebrate small wins every sprint.

## Impact so far  
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Lead-time ↓ | **‒60 %** at a global telco (5 k staff) |
| Release freq ↑ | **×3** at a fintech—unlocked Series C |
| OPEX saved | **€18 m** in 12 months at a Tier-1 bank |

## Why it matters to you  
Your competitors aren’t waiting. Neither should you.
